-----Single Agent----------

example : A simple model with one template, one instance, various kind of transitions [loops, guards/updates with/without abstracted variable]

example-no-bounded-var : same model as example but abstracted variable is not in the header BOUNDED VARS

example-inequalities : a model similar to example but includes comparisons in some guards

example-redundant-transitions: a model similar to example but some transitions leads to indistinguishable transitions in the abstracted model


-----Multi Agent----------

shared-variable : a model with two agents and a shared transition between them involving the abstracted variable 

2agents : A model slightly more complex than shared-variable with other transitions than the shared one

4agents : A model slightly more complex than shared-variable with 4 agents that uses the abstracted variable

shared-transitions : a model with multiples agents and a few basic shared transitions between them
