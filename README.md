# STV - StraTegic Verifier

#### Collection of algorithms for verification of ATLir (and ATLIr) models

## Currently implemented models
Currently there are several models implemented in the tool. 
It is also possible to define other models using simple input language.

Available models:
+ Bridge scenario (two versions)
+ Castles
+ Dining Cryptographers
+ Machines and Robots in the factory (several versions)
+ Tian Ji
+ Drones and pollution
+ Random model
+ Asynchronous models
+ Selene e-voting protocol
+ Simple voting model (two versions)

## Other models
To create some of the models used in a various experiments, other model-checker tools were used.
Here is the list of created models.

Tamarin:
+ Prêt à Voter voting system
+ TMN protocol

UPPAAL:
+ Prêt à Voter voting system
+ vVote voting system

## Implemented algorithms
+ Fixpoint approximation (http://www.ifaamas.org/Proceedings/aamas2017/pdfs/p1241.pdf)
+ DominoDFS (http://www.ifaamas.org/Proceedings/aamas2019/pdfs/p197.pdf)
+ Strategy Logic with Simple Goals

## Requirements
+ Python 3.7 minimum
+ All libraries from requirements.txt

## Graphical Interface
There is also a graphical interface for the tool available.
As the tool itself, it's also a work in progress, so right now it supports only part of the models and algorithms.
It is available here: https://github.com/blackbat13/stv-ui
